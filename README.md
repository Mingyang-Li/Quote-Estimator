# Quote Estimator React Application (Front-end Only)
- Live demo: https://estimator-dev.netlify.app/
- This project is a restructured version of my initial attempt of making the same application.
- Old version: https://github.com/Mingyang-Li/Estimator-Archived

I made this project to learn React in general, no API calls, only static data - so I don't confuse myself too much at the start. The most tricky part of this project is handling user inputs from the UI and updating the states across components. 

During this process, I've learned:

1. Context API for state management (avoided prop-drilling)
2. Conditional rendering JSX.
3. React hooks (useState & useStyles, useContext)
4. Styling with Material-UI.
5. Deploying the app on Netlify CMS using Github CD/CI.
